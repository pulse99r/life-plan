- PROJECT NAME: life-plan

- PROJECT DESCRIPTION: Planning for life

- PROBLEM:  A majority of people spend more time planning for a Saturday afternoon party or a Thanksgiving dinner than they do planning for their lives.  Most of the time, things just happen, and we wait to see where we end up.  In a recent Ted Talk, someone posed the question, if we each had grid on the wall the had a small square to represent each week for ninety years (about the lifespan of a human being, 4680 boxes), that gets checked off to show how many were gone, and how many were remaining, how might that alter how we live our lives, how we perceived the passage of time? 

- SOLUTION:  I thought let me build an app that does that. Joe Kidd could enter his birthday, get his 4680 boxes, displayed, with the past grayed out.  He can go in and enter past accomplishments and their associated dates.  and he can plan out the rest of his life.  He can also enter specific goals, or projects, with planned start and end dates, then track his progress over time. Those project accomplishment will be visible as part of the big board of 4680 blocks. 

- FEATURES: 
  - User registration and login, password reset, two factor authentication, etc.
  - grid of 4680 blocks
  - clicking on a block should display the calendar week represented by that block. For instance if someone created an account for a child born yesterday, clicking the first box would display a calendar week for this week. The calendar week for each individual starts with their birthday in the week  of their birth. 
  - This in not intended to be a project management system...it is intended only to track people's overall plans for life, and keep track of accomplishments against those overall general plans. If someone plans to go to college, they might plan to finish in 4 years, and they might actually finish in 5, 6, 10 or 20 years.  Having a broad view of how plans are going, might be useful in answering questions like:
      - What got in the way of my plans?  
      - How can I stay on track in the future? 
      - Where else in my life are my planned target dates in jeopardy?
      - Are any oe my plans dependent on accomplishing other plans?
