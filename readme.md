Write a 30 to 50 paged story that is tells the autobiography of a 66 years old many who is returning to school to study Computer Science, and who wants to share his experience with younger students who are unaware of how the free education in primary schooling can impact the quality of their lives.  The old man, Kenti, emigrated from Jamaica to the United states in 1971.  A year later he started high school, and being completely unaware of what life could be in the U.S., as well as not knowing what education was available to reach any given goal, he drifted aimlessly, just making his way through school with no goal in mind. He didn't plan to go to college after high school.  So he was unprepared for college, which he decided on only in his senior year of hight school. Kenti had not engaged with the fundamental subjects, math (algebra, trigonometry, pre-calculus, calculus, geometry), history, upper level English, writing, foreign language.  Kenti education effectively stopped at an 8th grade reading level, which was barely sufficient for pursuing a college education. 

As a direct result of his lack of preparation for college, Kenti failed basic math course in college, did poorly in English Lit courses, had to take remedial spanish language courses in order to meet basic requirements. Eventually kenti dropped out of college and went to work, with a promise to return to school when he could afford to pay for school.

Kenti also studied music.  He started guitar lessons at age fourteen and studied for one year before discontinuing.  Discontinuing was primarily a financial decision.  His mom couldn't afford the five dollars to pay for the half-hour guitar lesson each week. And being a teen, Kenti made the mistake of using that five dollars, on two occasions, to go to the movies instead of the guitar lesson.  When Mom found out, that was the end of guitar lessons.

The one area of preparation Kenti had engaged with in high school is that he took business courses such as typing, office administration, accounting, as well as vocational courses such as drafting, radio and tv electronics, and woodworking, which set him up for working blue collar type jobs and office work.  After dropping out of college, he took a few continuing education courses in computer science, which provided a good entry point and growth opportunity in office work. So even without a college degree, Kenti was able rise to an income level of eighty-seven thousand dollars annually by the time he reached age 57. However he then lost his job, and had no income, and without a college degree, he was unable to get a new job. 

So this is how a sixty-six year old man decides to return to school to get his Bachelors in Computer Science. Kenti now believes if someone had taken the time to provide Kenti with some counseling, on American culture, the available opportunities, the training needed to get there, and the lifestyle that could result from the application of effort in early education, he might have had a completely different life.
